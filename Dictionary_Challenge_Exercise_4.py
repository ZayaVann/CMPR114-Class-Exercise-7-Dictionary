# TOTAL SALES APP: 
# Design a program that asks the user to enter a storeâ€™s sales for each day of the week. 
# The amount should be stored in a list. 
# Use loop to calculate the total sales for the week and display the result. 
# Plus output the results into a text file as well as the console.
