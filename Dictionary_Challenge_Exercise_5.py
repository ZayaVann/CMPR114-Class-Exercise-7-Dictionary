# RAINFALL APP: 
# Design a program that letâ€™s the user to enter the total rainfall 
# for each of the 12 months into a list. 
# The program should calculate and display the total rainfall 
# for the year, the average monthly rainfall, 
# the months with the highest and lowest amounts of rainfall. 
# Plus output the results into a text file as well as the console.

# Constants
year = 12
